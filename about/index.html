    I am a third year computer science student at the University of Waterloo.  I am interested in highly scalable systems, and find myself constantly seeking out and learning of cases where distributed computing has been applied to effectively service the load required to run services like Amazon, Dropbox, LinkedIn etc.  When I am not pursuing this goal, my other hobbies include playing billiards, drawing, and exercising.
