So I have finally decided to start blogging and today I will be writing down some thoughts about scalable systems.
In my previous internship at Minted, I was assigned to the fulfillment team, working on their services related to customer order fulfillment.
It was an amazing experience that gave me a window into the world of e-commerce and how customers order products to getting them shipped right to their doorsteps.  

However, not only does this present a unique experience, but it also provides some interesting challenges.  One such challenge is the need to scale.  The ability to scale under massive growth piqued my interest and in the last few months I have learned quite a bit about potential solutions and architecture patterns to deal with these types of challenges.  Distributed systems, service oriented architecture, highly scalable massive throughput systems has become one of my favourite topics to read about.  

As I feel like this would be a great habit to form, I will be blogging about my learnings related to distributed systems, high throughput computing, and various techniques related to scaling web services.

Thats all for now!
